1) pdf file contain-supervised machine learning,workflow from data to decision,data nuances,bining and its types and log,log squared ,boxcox tranformation for skewness removal  <br />
2) Matplotlib_subplot_Skewness.ipynb contain - removal of skewness using  log tranformation,log squared tranformation ,boxcox tranformation on california_housing_test dataset  <br />
3) csv file( california_housing_test) that will work on for skewness removal <br /> 
4) pdf file (feature engineering) contain-feature selection,feature extraction,model centric,feature centric,feature engineering example
<br /> 
(note:- skewness and kurtosis should be between 0-2 then we can say the distribution is normal)
